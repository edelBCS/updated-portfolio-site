        <p>This was a group project where we realized that we all had one thing in common, we all like and/or played Pokemon GO at
            somepoint in our lives. So we decided to take this love of Pokemon and create a Pokemon GO like game that would allow those with physical
            disabilities to play even if they are not able to physically move around the world.</p>
