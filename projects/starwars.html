        <p>This was a simple turn based fighting game that was the precursor to Pokemon Stay. You start by choosing your
            champion and your opponent. You can choose from three abilities Fight, Dodge, or Defend. As you defeat opponents, your
            champion becomes stronger.  Keep fighting until all the opponents are defeated, or you are. </p>
